## Overview
This repo is a experiment of writing simple and low latency 10GBASE-R PCS for receiving and transmitting Ethernet packets on full 10Gbit/s speed without drop. 
PCS architecture based on IEEE Std 802.3-2008 standard and testing on Intel FPGA. Anyway, it can be easily ported for another vendors, as used standard input and output interfaces.
